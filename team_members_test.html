            <h1>Xuanhe Fan</h1>
            <p>Xuanhe Fan is the student leader, who comes from Shanxi province, that is the hometown of old castle, extensive and profound culture. She can hang on street during a whole day, but also discuss the work plots with teammates for two hours in one breath. With her eloquence, our team connected many teams and universities to cooperate. Out of the work, She is also very serious about losing weight and insists on it. </p>

            <h1>Haosheng Liu</h1>
            <p>If you don't know, you might think he's the leader because he talks too much. Whether in on-line meetings with others or in our team gathering, he always chatters away. Of course, he is also the spokesman of our team. When dealing with problems, he can always catch the point.<br>
                What I don't understand is why he has to talk in the lab. Maybe he wants to make bacteria obedient by language. If so, I hope he can speak more.</p>

            <h1>Huiwen Zheng</h1>
            <p>Huiwen is a fitness guru & a gourmet (yes, the kind of friend we all envy). Do aerobic exercise and eat good food in any season. There is no doubt that Huiwen's rich repertoire of skills has helped the team solve many technical problems (especially in response to PI's tricky criticism)<br>
                BTW, Huiwen plans to become a gym coach or selling delicious breakfast in the future.</p>

            <h1>Yiqi Zhao</h1>
            <p>Yiqi is an elegant lady in front of strangers, but in front of friends is a very funny person. She often laughs with her friends, which brings a lot of happiness to them. That's what she's good at - sharing life with friends and turning it into happiness.<br>
                The happy lady is also a video blogger. If you want to take courses like Cell Biology, subscribe her!</p>

            <h1>Ao Wang</h1>
            <p>The report of Ao’s chemical composition inspection: patience, carefulness, brilliant smile and a lot of calm.<br>
                She is always down-to-earth and patient with those very difficult problems. With her around, things would seem less hard - even if our experiment failed again.<br>
                She also enjoys playing the violin, but these days her score is all Chinese folk songs, her violin didn’t say anything so far. </p>

            <h1>Yuting Sun</h1>
            <p>One of the talents who masters the art designing skills in the team. If one of our team leaders has procrastination, it's all because he has efficient teammates like Yuting who can finish the task in a very short time.<br>
                Well, many good ideas are related to Yuting, such as……<br>
                To tell you the truth, she wrote the following paragraph.</p>

            <h1>Xinyi Bai</h1>
            <p>Xinyi is a crazy workaholic with a well-organized life. Although she works 12 hours a day, she still has to reflect on her own. However, she has the habit of whispering when she is preoccupied. But it has to be said that she is a reliable partner with quick thinking and everything will go well with her. It is shocking that as she spends 90% of her living expenses on food, she can still maintain a normal figure. It seems that hard work can make people slim.</p>

            <h1>Jiayi Gu</h1>
            <p>If you have any academic questions, try to ask Jiayi! Jiayi is quiet sometimes, but it doesn't mean she is silent. She didn't speak just because everything was in her hands. If you take time to get along with her, you will find that she is a friend you can depend on.<br>
                If Jiayi has a task, you just need to give her a little time. She'll disappear for hours, and come back with the results and ask you: what's next?</p>

            <h1>Yanjiao Jiang</h1>
            <p>Yanjiao is the curious baby in the team. She always becomes the questioner who breaks the deadlock when the meeting is cold or everyone can't understand what is going on. (That's why Huiwen always wants to join her in discussions.).<br>
                If you want to find her, go to the Library - she should be getting a VIP card, “Reader of the Year Award” or something else.</p>

            <p>Shuqing is a gentle and powerful girl, a reliable teammate. Her ability to learn new things is just as amazing as her high GPA. She can quickly master all kinds of analysis tools and give ideal results. Without her, it may be much more difficult for us to find the ideal genes and design sequences.</p>

            <p>As the technician in the team, Zhenyao undertook almost all the dry lab work. He also made a great contribution for the construction of Wiki. Zhenyao is one of the most sensitive people on the team to deadlines, because he is often responsible for pushing others. (it's really useful)
                Usually, he stays in his electronic equipment shop. If you want to change the screen of mobile phone, the manual fee is ¥100. </p>

                Believe me, it's not easy to communicate with Jinhong online. Leaders don't talk much.</p>
